    This is the canonical VOFC heuristic integration.
    It replaces all previous heuristic parsers.
    It segments document text into vulnerabilities and options for consideration,
    deduplicates OFCs, scores confidence, and inserts into Supabase.

heuristic_bridge:
  path: "apps/backend/server/pipeline/heuristic_bridge.py"
  entrypoint: "run_heuristics"
  description: >
    Bridge script that connects VOFC Engine to the global Ollama pipeline.
    Use this for all heuristic processing within the VOFC Engine project.
