  "output": "It looks like the tool, `parse_pdf`, failed to process the input file `data/temp_data.json` because it doesn't exist.\n\nTo proceed, I recommend creating a new JSON file containing the vulnerabilities and options for consideration (OFCs) you want to extract from PDF documents. You can use any text editor or a tool like `jsonlint` to create this file.\n\nOnce you have created the input file, you can re-run the `parse_pdf` tool with the correct file path.\n\nHere's an example of what your JSON file could look like:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"vulnerability\": \"The facility lacks access control for special events\",\n    \"category\": \"Physical Security\",\n    \"sector\": \"Critical Infrastructure\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"vulnerability\": \"Limited CCTV coverage in parking areas\",\n    \"category\": \"Electronic Security\",\n    \"sector\": \"Public Safety\"\n  },\n  ...\n]\n```\nAfter creating the input file, you can re-run the `parse_pdf` tool with the correct file path:\n```bash\nparse_pdf -i data/new_temp_data.json -o output.json\n```\nThis should generate a new JSON file called `output.json` containing the extracted vulnerabilities and OFCs. You can then use this file as input for the other tools, such as `normalize_json` and `link_supabase`.",
