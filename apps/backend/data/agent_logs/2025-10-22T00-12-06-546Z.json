The `processing_status` field indicates that the process has failed.\n\nBased on this output, it's not entirely clear what to do next. However, I can suggest a few possibilities:\n\n1. Check the error logs: Since the processing status is \"failed\", it's likely that there was an error during the processing step. You might want to check the error logs to see what went wrong and how to fix it.\n2. Retry the process: If you're sure that the input data is correct, you could try retrying the process to see if it succeeds the second time around.\n3. Investigate the issue further: If you're not sure why the process failed, you might want to investigate the issue further by looking at the tool's documentation or seeking help from a developer.\n\nWhat do you think?",
