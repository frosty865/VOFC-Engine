  "output": "The `parse_pdf` tool seems to have encountered an error. Let's investigate further!\n\nSince the `normalize_json` tool is dependent on a normalized JSON file, it appears that this step has not been completed successfully. The error message suggests that the `data/normalized.json` file does not exist.\n\nTo proceed, I recommend running the `parse_pdf` and `normalize_json` tools in sequence to extract vulnerabilities and OFCs from PDF documents and clean the extracted data.\n\nHere's a suggested workflow:\n\n1. Run `parse_pdf --input_file path/to/input/pdf --output_file data/temp.json`\nThis will extract vulnerabilities and OFCs from the PDF document and save the output as `data/temp.json`.\n\n2. Once the parsing is successful, run `normalize_json --input_file data/temp.json --output_file data/normalized.json`\nThis will clean and structure the extracted data into a normalized JSON file.\n\n3. Finally, verify that the `data/normalized.json` file exists and then proceed to link the processed data into the Supabase database using the `link_supabase` tool.\n\nBy addressing the issue with the missing file, we should be able to successfully complete the next steps in the process.",
