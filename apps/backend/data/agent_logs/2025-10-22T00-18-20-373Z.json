  "output": "It looks like the `parse_pdf` tool is trying to process a JSON file (`data/temp_data.json`) but it's not found. This could be due to a few reasons:\n\n1. The file doesn't exist.\n2. The file is not in the correct location (i.e., not in the `data` directory).\n\nTo resolve this, I recommend the following steps:\n\n1. Check if the file exists and is in the correct location. If it's not, create the file or move it to the correct location.\n2. If the file exists but is empty or contains invalid data, you can try cleaning up any unnecessary files in the `data` directory.\n\nBefore re-running the tool, let's make sure we have a valid input file. We can use the `normalize_json` tool to verify that our JSON file is correct and structured properly.\n\nRun the following command:\n```\nnormalize_json -i data/temp_data.json\n```\nThis will check if the JSON file is well-formed and print any errors or warnings. If everything looks good, you can re-run the `parse_pdf` tool with the corrected input file.",
