  "output": "It looks like the `parse_pdf` tool is trying to process a JSON file that doesn't exist (`data/temp_data.json`). This could be due to a few reasons:\n\n1. The file was not generated or uploaded correctly.\n2. The file path is incorrect.\n\nTo resolve this issue, I recommend the following steps:\n\n1. Check if the `temp_data.json` file exists in the specified directory (`data/`). If it doesn't exist, you'll need to generate or upload the correct file before proceeding.\n2. Verify the file path and ensure that it's correct. Double-check the file name and directory structure.\n\nIf the issue persists, we can try running the `parse_pdf` tool with a different input file or directory to see if it resolves the problem.\n\nLet me know how you'd like to proceed!",
