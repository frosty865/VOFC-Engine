  "output": "It seems that the initial attempt to link data to Supabase has failed due to a missing file, `data/linked.json`. To proceed, I recommend the following steps:\n\n1. **Create the `data/linked.json` file**: Since this file is expected for linking data to Supabase, we need to create it. You can start by creating an empty JSON file with the desired structure.\n2. **Review the Supabase documentation**: Familiarize yourself with Supabase's documentation on linking data and managing relationships. This will help you understand the requirements for the `data/linked.json` file and any potential errors.\n3. **Update the `data/linked.json` file**: Once you have a basic understanding of the required structure, update the file to include the necessary information. You can refer to the Supabase documentation or existing examples for guidance.\n\nAfter creating the `data/linked.json` file and updating it according to the Supabase requirements, you can attempt linking data to Supabase again.",
