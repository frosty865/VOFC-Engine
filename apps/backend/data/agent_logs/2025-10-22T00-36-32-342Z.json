  "output": "It seems that the `parse_pdf` tool failed to process the input file due to a missing or non-existent file. To proceed, I recommend the following steps:\n\n1. Verify the existence of the input file: Check if the file `data/temp_data.json` actually exists and is in the correct location.\n2. Correct the file path (if necessary): If the file is not present, you can either create a new file with the same name or adjust the file path to point to the correct location.\n3. Rerun the `parse_pdf` tool: Once the file issue is resolved, rerun the `parse_pdf` tool to extract vulnerabilities and options for consideration (OFCs) from the PDF document.\n\nHere's an example command:\n```bash\nparse_pdf data/temp_data.json > output.json\n```\nThis will attempt to parse the JSON file and generate a new output file with the extracted data. If the file is still missing or incorrect, you may need to re-examine your file system or adjust your code accordingly.\n\nAfter running the `parse_pdf` tool, you can then use the other tools (e.g., `normalize_json`, `link_supabase`, and `verify_json`) to process and integrate the extracted data into your Supabase database.",
