# Security Planning Workbook

## Vulnerability Assessment

Many facilities lack proper access control systems. This includes physical security gaps, cybersecurity weaknesses, and procedural deficiencies.
The facility perimeter lacks adequate surveillance and monitoring capabilities.

## Options for Consideration

1. Implement comprehensive security measures including cameras, lighting, and access controls.
2. Conduct regular security assessments to identify vulnerabilities
3. Establish incident response procedures
4. Train staff on security awareness
5. Maintain updated security policies and procedures

## Access Control Issues

Organizations should identify potential security vulnerabilities in their systems, including unpatched software, misconfigured networks, and inadequate access controls.

## Perimeter Security

The facility perimeter lacks adequate surveillance and monitoring capabilities.
Organizations should implement comprehensive perimeter security measures including cameras, lighting, and access controls.
