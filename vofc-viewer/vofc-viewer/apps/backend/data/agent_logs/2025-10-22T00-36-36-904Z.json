  "output": "The tool has encountered an error. Let's analyze the issue:\n\n* The error message indicates that the input file \"data/temp_data.json\" does not exist.\n* This suggests that there might be a missing or incorrect file path.\n\nTo resolve this, I recommend the following steps:\n\n1. Verify the existence of the file: Check if the file \"data/temp_data.json\" actually exists in your directory. If it doesn't, you'll need to create it or obtain the correct file.\n2. Update the input file path (if necessary): If the file does exist, double-check that the file path is correctly specified in the tool's configuration or command-line argument.\n\nAfter resolving this issue, re-run the `parse_pdf` tool with the corrected input file path. This should allow the tool to successfully extract vulnerabilities and OFCs from the PDF document.\n\nIf you're still experiencing issues, feel free to ask for further assistance!",
