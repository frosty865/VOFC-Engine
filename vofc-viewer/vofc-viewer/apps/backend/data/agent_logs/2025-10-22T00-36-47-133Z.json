  "output": "The tool output indicates that the processing of the normalized JSON file failed because it does not exist. This suggests that the previous steps to extract and clean the data from the PDF files did not complete successfully.\n\nTo resolve this issue, I recommend running the tools in the correct order:\n\n1. `parse_pdf`: Extract vulnerabilities and OFCs from PDF documents.\n2. `normalize_json`: Clean and structure the extracted data into a JSON file named \"normalized.json\".\n\nAfter these two steps are completed successfully, you can run `link_supabase` to import the processed data into the Supabase database.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use the tools in sequence:\n```bash\n# Parse PDF files\nparse_pdf --input_files=data/vulnerability_reports/*.pdf\n\n# Normalize extracted data\nnormalize_json --input_file=data/extracted_data.json --output_file=data/normalized.json\n\n# Link normalized data to Supabase database\nlink_supabase --input_file=data/normalized.json\n```\nOnce the data is successfully imported into the Supabase database, you can run `verify_json` to verify the data integrity and citations.\n\nRemember to check the output of each tool for any errors or warnings.",
