  "output": "It looks like the `parse_pdf` tool is trying to process a JSON file that doesn't exist. This could be due to a few reasons:\n\n1. The JSON file was not generated or uploaded correctly.\n2. The file path is incorrect.\n\nTo proceed, I recommend the following steps:\n\n1. Check if the JSON file exists and is in the correct location (`data/temp_data.json`).\n2. If the file doesn't exist, try re-generating or uploading it using the correct process.\n3. If the file exists but the `parse_pdf` tool still fails, check the file for any errors or corruption.\n\nBefore running the `parse_pdf` tool again, let's make sure we have a valid JSON file to process. This will ensure that our subsequent steps are accurate and reliable.\n\nOnce we have a correct JSON file, we can proceed with normalizing the data using the `normalize_json` tool.",
