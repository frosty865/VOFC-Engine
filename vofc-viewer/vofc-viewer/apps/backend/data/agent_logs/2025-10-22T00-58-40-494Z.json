The tool suggests providing the actual PDF file and following a series of steps to resolve the issue.\n\nTo proceed, I recommend the following:\n\n1. Provide the actual PDF file: Make sure you have the correct PDF file ready for processing.\n2. Run the `parse_pdf` command: Use the `$ parse_pdf <input_pdf_file>.pdf` command to start processing the PDF file.\n3. Normalize the JSON output: Once the PDF is parsed, run the `$ normalize_json output.json > data/normalized.json` command to normalize the JSON output.\n4.
