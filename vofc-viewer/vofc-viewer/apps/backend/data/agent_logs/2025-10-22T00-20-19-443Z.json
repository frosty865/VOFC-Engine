  "output": "Based on the tool output, it appears that there was an error processing a PDF file. To resolve the issue, I recommend following the recommended steps:\n\n1. Check if the file `data/normalized.json` exists by running the command `ls data/normalized.json`.\n2. If the file does not exist, run the `parse_pdf` tool on the original PDF files to extract vulnerabilities and OFCs: `parse_pdf(input_file='path/to/original/pdf/file.pdf', output_file='data/extracted.json')`.\n3. Once the extraction is complete, re-run the `normalize_json` tool on the newly generated file: `normalize_json(input_file='data/extracted.json', output_file='data/normalized.json')`.\n4. Verify the integrity of the processed data: `verify_json(input_file='data/normalized.json')`.\n\nBy following these steps, we should be able to troubleshoot the error and extract the required information from the PDF file.",
