  "output": "The `parse_pdf` tool is not being used in this case, and the error message suggests that there's a file-not-found issue with the expected output of the `normalize_json` tool. This indicates that the `normalize_json` tool hasn't been run or the output file doesn't exist.\n\nTo resolve this issue, I recommend running the `parse_pdf` tool first to extract vulnerabilities and OFCs from the PDF documents. Once the extraction is complete, you can then use the extracted data as input for the `normalize_json` tool.\n\nHere's a suggested workflow:\n\n1. Run the `parse_pdf` tool with the required input (e.g., the PDF file(s)) to extract vulnerabilities and OFCs.\n2. Use the output from step 1 as input for the `normalize_json` tool to clean and structure the extracted data.\n3. Once the normalization is complete, use the output of the `normalize_json` tool as input for the `link_supabase` tool to import the processed data into the Supabase database.\n\nAfter completing these steps, you can re-run the `verify_json` tool to verify the integrity of the data and its citations.\n\nPlease note that the error message suggests a file-not-found issue with the expected output of the `normalize_json` tool. Once you've resolved this issue by running the tools in the correct order, you should be able to proceed with the analysis.",
