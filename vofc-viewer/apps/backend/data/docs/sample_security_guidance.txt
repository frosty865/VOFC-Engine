Healthcare Facility Security Guidelines

The following security measures should be implemented to protect healthcare facilities and ensure patient safety:

1. Access Control Systems
   - Healthcare facilities should implement multi-factor authentication for all electronic systems
   - Physical access controls should be established for restricted areas such as operating rooms and medication storage
   - Visitor management systems must be implemented to track and monitor all non-staff personnel

2. Emergency Preparedness
   - Hospitals should maintain redundant backup power systems to ensure continuous operation during outages
   - Emergency communication systems must be tested regularly to ensure reliability
   - Staff should be trained on emergency response procedures and evacuation protocols

3. Data Protection
   - Patient data must be encrypted both in transit and at rest
   - Regular security audits should be conducted to identify vulnerabilities
   - Staff must receive cybersecurity training to recognize and prevent phishing attacks

4. Physical Security
   - Security cameras should be installed in all public areas and critical locations
   - Lighting should be adequate in parking areas and exterior walkways
   - Security personnel should be present during all operating hours

5. Supply Chain Security
   - Medical supply deliveries should be verified and tracked
   - Storage areas for medications and medical equipment must be secured
