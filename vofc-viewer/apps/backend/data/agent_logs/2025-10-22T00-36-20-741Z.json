  "output": "It looks like the script is trying to read a JSON file named `linked.json` located in the `data` folder, but it can't find it. This could be due to the file not existing or being in the wrong location.\n\nTo resolve this issue, let's try the following steps:\n\n1. Check if the `linked.json` file exists in the `data` folder and make sure it's named correctly.\n2. If the file doesn't exist, create a new JSON file with the correct name and content. For example, you could create an empty JSON object `{}` to start with.\n3. Verify that the file is in the correct location (i.e., in the `data` folder) and has the correct name (`linked.json`).\n4. If you're still having issues, try checking the script's permissions or ownership of the file to ensure it can read the JSON data.\n\nOnce we resolve this issue, we should be able to successfully read the JSON data and link it to Supabase for further analysis!",
