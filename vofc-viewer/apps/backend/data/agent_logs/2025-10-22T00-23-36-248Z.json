  "output": "It looks like the `parse_pdf` tool is trying to process a JSON file that doesn't exist. This suggests that either:\n\n1. The input file 'data/temp_data.json' was not generated or does not contain the expected data.\n2. The file path is incorrect, and the file is actually located elsewhere.\n\nTo resolve this issue, I recommend checking the following:\n\n1. Verify the existence of the file 'data/temp_data.json' and its contents.\n2. If the file exists, check if it's a valid JSON file containing the expected data (vulnerabilities and OFCs).\n3. If the file is missing or invalid, try to generate the expected output by running the `parse_pdf` tool with the correct input.\n\nIf you're still facing issues, please provide more details about the error message, and I'll be happy to help you troubleshoot further!",
