This means we need to ensure that the necessary files are present before attempting to run the analysis.\n\nHere's a suggested course of action:\n\n1. **Verify the existence of the input file**: Check if the \"data/normalized.json\" file actually exists on your system. If not, you'll need to generate this file by running the `parse_pdf` tool on the relevant PDF document.\n2. **Run the `parse_pdf` tool again**: Once the input file is generated or verified, re-run the `parse_pdf` tool to extract the vulnerabilities and OFCs from the PDF document.\n\nThis should produce a new output that can be further processed using the other tools (e.g., `normalize_json`, `link_supabase`).",
