  "output": "The tool output indicates that there is no PDF file available for processing. To resolve this issue, you need to provide the actual PDF file and follow the recommended steps.\n\nHere are the suggested steps:\n\n1. Provide the actual PDF file: You need to provide the correct PDF file that needs to be processed.\n2. Run the `parse_pdf` command with the input PDF file: Use the `$ parse_pdf <input_pdf_file>.pdf` command to start processing the PDF file.\n3. After parsing the PDF, run `normalize_json`: Once the PDF is parsed, you need to normalize the JSON output using the `$ normalize_json output.json > data/normalized.json` command.\n4. Extract vulnerabilities and OFCs: Once the previous steps are completed, you can proceed with extracting vulnerabilities and OFCs from the PDF document.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue and successfully extract vulnerabilities and OFCs from the PDF file.",
