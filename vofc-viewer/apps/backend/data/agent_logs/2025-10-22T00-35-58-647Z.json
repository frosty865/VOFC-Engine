  "output": "It looks like the tool is trying to read a JSON file named \"linked.json\" from a folder called \"data\", but it can't find that file. This could be because the file doesn't exist or the path is incorrect.\n\nTo resolve this issue, I would suggest checking if the file actually exists in the specified location and verifying the path. If the file does not exist, we'll need to create it or provide a different input file for the tool to process.\n\nLet's try to locate the \"linked.json\" file and verify its contents. Once that's done, we can proceed with using the data in Supabase.",
