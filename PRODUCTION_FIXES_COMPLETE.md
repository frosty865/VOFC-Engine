# ✅ Production Issues - RESOLVED

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **404 Error for favicon.ico** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Missing favicon.ico file causing 404 errors
- **Solution**: Added favicon.ico to the public directory
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### 2. **400 Errors from Supabase Queries** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Database queries failing with 400 errors
  - `subsectors?select=*&order=subsector_name.asc` → 400 error
  - `options_for_consideration?select=*%2Cofc_sources%28*%2Csources%28%22reference+number%22%2Csource%29%29&order=id.asc` → 400 error
- **Root Cause**: Database schema mismatches and missing tables
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed column name references in API routes
  - Created missing tables (sectors, subsectors, disciplines)
  - Updated queries to use correct column names
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

### 3. **Message Channel Errors** ✅ IDENTIFIED
- **Problem**: "A listener indicated an asynchronous response by returning true, but the message channel closed before a response was received"
- **Root Cause**: Browser extension conflicts (not application errors)
- **Solution**: These are harmless browser extension conflicts
- **Status**: ✅ IDENTIFIED (Not application errors)
