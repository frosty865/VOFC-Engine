Category,Vulnerability,"Options for Consideration",Sources
Insider Threat,"The facility does not have a comprehensive program to mitigate threats from insiders (employees, former employees, contractors, or partners).","Establish a program to mitigate insider threats, which can include malicious, unintentional, or complacent acts that harm an organization.","[cite: 2]"
Insider Threat,"The facility's security culture does not adequately address unintentional insider threats, such as negligence or accidents.","Conduct continuous employee training and awareness programs to educate staff on security policies and the dangers of negligent actions.","[cite: 2, 6]"
Insider Threat,"The facility is vulnerable to malicious insider actions, such as theft, sabotage, espionage, or workplace violence, from individuals who already have authorized access.","Incorporate non-IT data sources, such as HR records (performance reviews, disciplinary actions) and legal data, into threat management platforms to get a more complete view of potential insider threats.","[cite: 3]"
Cyber-Physical Security,"The facility's physical security systems (e.g., access control, CCTV, HVAC) are connected to the IT network, but are managed by separate, non-collaborating departments.","Establish formal collaboration and convergence between previously disjointed security functions, such as cybersecurity and physical security teams, to create a unified security policy.","[cite: 4, 5, 8]"
Cyber-Physical Security,"A cyberattack could be used to disable or manipulate physical security systems, such as remotely unlocking doors, disabling alarms, or overriding HVAC systems to cause damage.","Invest in integrated security infrastructure and platforms that allow for centralized monitoring and data sharing between cyber and physical systems.","[cite: 4, 8]"
Physical Supply Chain,"The facility lacks security protocols for its supply chain, creating risks from external suppliers, vendors, logistics, and transportation.","Implement a supply chain security strategy that identifies, analyzes, and mitigates risks associated with outside organizations.","[cite: 11, 12]"
Physical Supply Chain,"Cargo, raw materials, or finished goods are vulnerable to theft, tampering, or sabotage while in transit or at loading docks.","Use locks and tamper-evident shipping seals for all shipments.","[cite: 11]"
Social Engineering (Tailgating / Piggybacking),"The facility is vulnerable to tailgating (an unauthorized person slipping through an entry point behind an authorized person) or piggybacking (an authorized person knowingly or unknowingly allowing an unauthorized person to follow them).","Educate employees on the risks of tailgating and social engineering, instructing them to not hold doors for others and to ensure doors close securely behind them.","[cite: 6, 7]"
